# Project - Cygnet Lawn and Maintenance

This project is a commercial page designed pro bono for my brother who is starting a new business.
His brief to me was to create a page which provided a relevant online presence which would persuade the visitor to make contact and get a quote.
He also wanted this achieved in a simple way as his market demographic is older and less tech savvy than younger generations in general.

## UX

Given the brief it was clear we needed to have strong clear pitch throughout the page to reiterate to the visitor why it was worthwhile to get in touch for a quote.
This meant considering the key value propostion that needed communicating within a relatively short space of time to spark interest and potentially inspire a connection.
With a clear purpose of generating as higher chance of a customer making contact, this objective is reflected through the many possible 'get quote' touch points
through out the page.  There is also a clear call to action on the landing page and a clear 'why' message in the about page presented almost immediately, followed by the services offered.
The presence of the phone number in the corner is an important consideration, my brother Ken has often found his customers like an easy way to get in touch and has taken feedback that other businesses are too hard to navigate to the phone number.
Again this is a reflection of the bulk of his customer base at the moment, which tends to be the thirty five to forty plus age bracket.  That said, if a younger demographic visits the page still needs
to look interesting and colorful enough to hold their interest and potentially inspire a connection as well.
