# Project - Cygnet Lawn and Maintenance

This project is a commercial page designed for my brother who is starting a new lawn mowing and garden maintenance business.
His brief was to create a page which provided a relevant online presence and which would persuade the visitor to make contact and get a quote.
He also wanted this achieved in a simple and clear way as his market demographic is older and less tech savvy than younger generations in general.

## UX

Given the brief it was clear we needed to have strong clear pitch throughout the page to reiterate to the visitor why it was worthwhile to get in touch for a quote.
This meant considering the key value propostion that needed communicating within a relatively short space of time to spark interest and potentially inspire a connection.
With a clear purpose of generating as higher chance of a customer making contact, this objective is reflected through the many possible 'get quote' touch points
through out.  There is also a clear call to action on the landing page and a clear 'why' message in the about page presented almost immediately, followed by the services offered.
The presence of the phone number in the corner is an important consideration, my brother Ken has often found his customers like an easy way to get in touch and has taken feedback that other businesses are too hard to navigate to the phone number.
Again this is a reflection of the bulk of his customer base at the moment, which tends to be the older age bracket.  That said, if a younger demographic visits the page it still needs
to look interesting and colorful enough to hold their interest and potentially inspire a connection as well.

For the wireframes I used Figma and they can be found [Here.](https://www.figma.com/file/TFhKUFZm6Jwh3Q1qq7ujJ9hu/Explore?node-id=18%3A162)

I initially designed wireframes for the mobile and then the desktop and then I settled on the desktop styling for the final site.


## Features

### Existing Features

There are four key sections to the site

1.  Landing Page
2.  About Page
3.  Services Page
4.  Contact Page

Each section is designed to reinforce a different value propostion in order to persuade a customer to make contact.  A button is visible at each section for easy access to the quote modal/section.

### Features Left to Implement

As the business matures the client will be collecting positive customer testimonials and also a gallery of photos which will each have their own section.


## Technologies Used

The following was used to construct the site:

1. [Cloud9](https://c9.io/login)
2. CSS
3. HTML
4. [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
5. [Github](https://github.com/)
6. [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (Wireframes)

## Testing

The site achieves the objective to the give the new business a bright fresh online presence and gives mulitiple opportunities for potential customers to connect and get a quote.

Currently the social media links are not working as the pages are not created but they will be soon and I wanted to leave them there for design purposes.

The site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone X : Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy S7) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
